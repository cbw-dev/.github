# README.md

I am not sure if there is a better way to put a clarification on the cbw-dev repo, but here is some sort of explanation.

- **.github** = holds this README.md
- **cbw-dev.github.io** = has the index.md file for the main website [https://cbw-dev.github.io/](https://cbw-dev.github.io/)
- **demo-repository** = some sort of default repo I tihnk github made when we made the organization

# BOOKDOWN GITBOOK
*Note: GitBook is it's own thing, this is bookdown's version/inspired by GitBook*

- **INR-2024-Recreate** = Recreating INR 2024 workshop, in the Bookdown Gitbook template (90% done, see it's README.md for notes)
- **bookdown-tes**t = Slightly edited (barely anything) standard bookdown gitbook template
- **fig-bkdn-test** = Unedited (I strongly think so) standard bookdown gitbook template (made to test a bug)
- **bkd-gitbk-htmlbug** = Pretty much unedited standard bookdown gitbook template (made to test a bug)
- **bookdown** = a copy of the "bookdown-demo", it is a bs4_book (which we probably will not use, mainly because gitbook looks nicer)

# CARPENTRIES
- **INR_2024_Recreate_Carpentries** = A work-in-progress recreation of the INR 2024 workshop, in the Carpentries (w/R) template
- **carp-w-o-R-test** = A cloned Carpentries w/o R (md files only) template
- **sandpaper-docs** = This is a cloned Carpentries workshop. The workhop explains how Sandpaper, one of the heavy-lifiting packages in the background of Carpentries templates, work.
- **carpentries-varnish-fork** = A fork of [carpentries varnish](https://github.com/carpentries/varnish) repo, which I added the bioinformatics.ca logo to, so that we can change the logo on our other Carpentry workshop template repos 


# JUPYTER BOOK
- **jb-intro-test-book** = testing the jupyter book template: result of following the beginner tutorial + testing things found in the docs
- **INR-2024-Recreate-JB** = A really simple Jupyer Book version of INR 2024, mainly a Proof of Concept
